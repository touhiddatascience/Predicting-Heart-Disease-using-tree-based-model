**About Dataset**

**Overview** 

This dataset contains medical data used for predicting heart disease. The data includes various attributes such as age, sex, chest pain type (cp), resting blood pressure (trestbps), cholesterol (chol), fasting blood sugar (fbs), resting electrocardiographic results (restecg), maximum heart rate achieved (thalach), exercise-induced angina (exang), and ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest (oldpeak).

Columns
age: Age of the patient (in years)
sex: Sex of the patient (1 = male, 0 = female)
cp: Chest pain type (1-4)
trestbps: Resting blood pressure (in mm Hg on admission to the hospital)
chol: Serum cholesterol in mg/dl
fbs: Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl (1 = true; 0 = false)
restecg: Resting electrocardiographic results (0-2)
thalach: Maximum heart rate achieved
exang: Exercise-induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)
oldpeak: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
